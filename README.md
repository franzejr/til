> Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post. These are mostly things I learn by myself or  pairing with
someone. I got this idea from [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).
